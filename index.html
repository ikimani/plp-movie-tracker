        <h3>My Take</h3>
        <p>I’ve never felt so entertained by psychological profiling. Every episode is a deep dive into twisted minds — and I’m <em>here</em> for it. Garcia is the queen of tech and sass, and I lowkey want to join the BAU.</p>

      <div class="my-opinion">
        <h3>My Take</h3>
        <p>This show is like adrenaline in high definition. Zoe Saldaña kills it. The stakes feel real, the missions are ruthless, and the female power? Unmatched. I binged it like a criminal on the run.</p>

      <h2>Red Sparrow</h2>
      <p><strong>Genre:</strong> Spy, Thriller, Drama</p>
      <p><strong>Release Date:</strong> February 28, 2018</p>
      <p><strong>Rating:</strong> ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ ❄️👠🕵️</p>
      <div class="my-opinion">
        <h3>My Take</h3>
        <p>Cold. Seductive. Ruthless. <em>Red Sparrow</em> is a slow burn that rewards patience with plot twists and power plays. Jennifer Lawrence owns every scene — and the Russian spy vibes? Icy perfection.</p>
